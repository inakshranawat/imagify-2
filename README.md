Credit-based model: users consume credits to generate images, and when credits run out, they can purchase more via Razorpay. (Referenced in your description; aligns with typical SaaS billing integration; not explicitly documented, but matches common designs)

Clean, modern interface built in React, offering intuitive access to prompt input and generated results.

Why It Matters:

Makes visual creativity accessible, allowing users to easily generate AI-driven imagery using simple text prompts.

Merges the flexibility of MERN development with SaaS billing and AI generationâ€”a solid platform for expanding features or integrations.
